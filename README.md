# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe game is a console-based application developed in C++ as part of a Programming Fundamentals project. It allows users to enjoy the classic game in two engaging modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer. The game features a clean interface, clear instructions, and logic to check for win, lose, or draw conditions after each move.

In the Player vs Player mode, two users alternate turns, with the program managing the game board and enforcing the rules. In the Player vs Computer mode, the user plays against a basic AI, where the computer makes logical moves based on available positions.

The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, arrays, and user input handling, making it a solid foundation for beginners in C++.
